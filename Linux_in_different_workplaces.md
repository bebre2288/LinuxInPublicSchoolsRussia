# Use of linux in different workplaces

Let me split "Use Of Linux In Workplaces" in parts by where and how is Linux used.


## School and Institutes
First of all I'd like to tell about Linux and Foss in educational environment.
As can be clearly stated of my research - that many schools use Linux etc. nowadays(if any).

Usually linux is in use by instituses, colleges(with IT workflow), IT lecturers and professors. Also linux is used for running school file servers, web hostings and probably some specialized connections that I do not know.

## Markets, shops
Sometimes linux is used by store consultants for checking availability, additional info, prices about products etc.
But more frequently Windows can be observed as only OS in stores.

## Government
No info that I can say say confidently. But as far as I know it is starting to be more and more widespread.
Also, interestingly, there was a moment when [guy was sued because he installed FOSS on hardware](https://www.securitylab.ru/news/540852.php)
(long story short: he *was* working for Roskosmos and installed FOSS alternative for some software that was already in use, after that FBI claimed that it all was insecure. So he was sued. That is it. I can see why it happened, so it is just sad, guy was wrong.)

## Everyone else
Afaik, at this moment (02-09-2023) linux is not used by lots and lots of corporations because... because... I dont know why. That's why. See? Easy!
Even programmers (if working in place, not from home) usually can't  choose os. Only Windows. Only proprietary software. That is realy upsetting at least for me.
