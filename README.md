Investigation about usage of linux in public schools in Russia

For moment of 02-09-2023 I am 11s grader (11 of total 11 years) in [russian school](http://sgls.admsurgut.ru/).
I have been using gnu/linux and other FOSS products for about 5 years now and tried to convince my friends switch from windows as I did. Sadly no one got rid of Windows OS, and I got interested why that is happening.

After some investigation an idea struck me: "Nobody knows about beauty of Linux because nobody uses it! If only more FOSS is going to be used in our schools..." And that is starting point of investigation about "THE USE OF FREE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT SCHOOLS".

Now I want to share my small (at this moment) research.
Feel free to ask questions in **issues**, I'll do my best to answer and extend this research repo
